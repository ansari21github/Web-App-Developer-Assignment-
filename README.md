## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: The navbar adapts to different screen sizes. On small screens, a menu icon is shown, and the links are hidden inside a dropdown menu.

- **Dynamic Content Sections**:Sections with content like titles, subtitles, and buttons are designed to be responsive. Each section adjusts its layout based on screen size for a consistent user experience.

- **Flex Layouts**: The layout makes use of Tailwind CSS flex utilities for structuring sections in either rows or columns, depending on the screen size.

- **Icons and Links**: Includes social media icons for Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.


## Additional Features

- **Mobile-first design**:The page is built with a mobile-first approach and scales up for larger screen sizes.

- **Hover effects**: Buttons and links have hover states for better user interaction.

- **Custom spacing**: Proper spacing is maintained between various elements for clean and readable layouts.
